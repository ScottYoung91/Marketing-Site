This is a Marketing Site that I built to showcase what I have learned in React. React is overkill for 90% of the site, but I wanted a Blog Component that could automatically pull blogs from a database and display them. It seemed like a good use case for reusuable components so I went for it.

I continue to maintain the site and use it for SEO practice. It hasn't generated any business....yet!

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
